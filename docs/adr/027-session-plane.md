# ADR-027 — Session plane (system glue, multi-instance)

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2026-07-30  
**Accepted:** 2026-07-30 (theme exit **0.58.20**)  
**Theme:** [VISION-0.58](../vision/closed/VISION-0.58.md) (**closed**)  
**Map:** [PALM.md](../PALM.md)  
**Migration / release:** [MIGRATION-0.58](../migrations/MIGRATION-0.58.md) · [RELEASE-0.58.20](../releases/RELEASE-0.58.20.md)  
**Supersedes (plan only):** watch-first sketch in [VISION-SESSION-PLANE](../vision/closed/VISION-SESSION-PLANE.md)

---

## Context

1. Palm has a named **system** layer ([ADR-026](026-palm-system-layer.md)): engines, ports, planes.  
2. **Event**, **work** (start), **wait** (continue), and **workload** planes exist or are scouting. **Session** has no system home (**SD-008**).  
3. Product and surfaces already use the word **session**. In code, `session_id` almost always **is** `instance_id`. That alias is a development shortcut, not architecture.  
4. Growth needs a subject that can hold **many instances** (many jobs over a walk): Assist continuity, cancel owned work, watches, later Grove affinity.  
5. Palm is not in production. We may break the alias. We must not invent a second resume law.  
6. Server bind can stay simple (cookie / header / WS bind). Transport is not the plane.

---

## Decision

### D1 — Session is a system plane

Session lifecycle and ownership live under **`palm.system`** (target package: `palm.system.planes.session`).  
Product services may expose thin handles. Product is **not** the source of session truth.

### D2 — Three distinct concepts

| Concept | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **Session** | Outside subject: one coherent external conversation / walk |
| **Instance** | Durable process record for a definition run |
| **Job** | Live orchestration unit |

A session may attach **zero or more** instances over time (**multi-instance**).  
Do not encode permanent 1:1 as law.

### D3 — Outside interaction binds a session

Surfaces (MCP, WS, HTTP, interactive CLI, composition edges that represent operator journeys) **create or bind** a session before they drive work.  
Bind transport may be cookie-like on the server. The plane still owns the record.

### D4 — Not a second continue path

Start remains **work plane**. Continue remains **wait plane** ([ADR-025](025-reactive-interests.md)).  
Session may **attribute**, **list**, and **watch** open waits and events. Session does **not** resume jobs by a private hook.

### D5 — Store is allowed and expected

The session plane may use a **store** (in-memory and/or durable via host storage).  
The store holds session records and attach lists. It is **not** a second job blackboard.  
A shared “every plane has one store framework” is **out of scope** for this ADR; design per plane until a later theme.

### D6 — Capable model from the start

Multi-instance attach, lifecycle (open / active / closed), and bind are in the **first** system design.  
Watches and rich product UI may come later in the same theme. They must not force a weak 1:1 core.

### D7 — Break aliases; record residual

Replace `session_id == instance_id` lies on paths the theme touches.  
List remaining consumers in [TECH-DEBT.md](../../TECH-DEBT.md) as **SI-*** (session impact).  
No long-lived dual-path shims for comfort.

### D8 — Not the user plane

No multi-user identity product, org presence, or Grove mesh in this decision.  
Optional opaque metadata on the session record is enough for later phenotypes.

### D9 — Exclusive instance ownership

An instance is attached to **at most one** session (reverse index on the plane).  
Another session **must not** attach or claim that instance.  
Ownership is the graph for cancel, watch, and journey. It is not optional soft metadata.

### D10 — Active instance is continue focus only (0.58.10)

`active_instance_id` on the session record is the plane-owned **continue focus** among  
instances **already attached** to that session.

- New attach may set focus to the new instance.  
- `set_active_instance` requires the id on the attach list.  
- `resolve_continue_instance` prefers active, then open wait, then last attached — all **inside** the owner list.  
- Active **must not** authorize drive of a foreign (non-owned) instance.

Session ≠ instance remains. Active ≠ owner pass.

### D11 — Elevated access later = policy, not dual ownership

Support, admin, or team “act on behalf of” must **not** break D9 by dual-owning instances.  
Future user-plane maturity should use **impersonation**, **delegate grants**, or **elevated inspect**  
under the **owning** session (or an explicit grant record). That is a later theme.  
See [VISION-0.58 §7.1](../vision/closed/VISION-0.58.md). Owner gate for bound session + continue is **SI-015** (**paid 0.58.11**).

---

## Consequences

### Positive

- One glue subject for surfaces, workloads, waits, and future walk.  
- Honest multi-instance growth with a clear continue focus.  
- Clear home next to other planes.  
- Server bind stays simple (cookie-like).  
- Room for user/admin maturity without dissolving ownership.

### Negative / cost

- Widespread rename and rebind of product/surface APIs.  
- Tests and dogfood that assumed session ≡ instance must change.  
- Temporary breakage until slices land (pre-1.0 accepted).  
- Product **gates** continue when a bound session is present (SI-015 / 0.58.11).  
- **Strict attribution (0.58.15):** when the plane is ready, start always has a
  system session; continue requires owner (bound session or plane reverse index);
  bare orphan refuse (`SessionAttributionError`). Compat:
  `PALM_SESSION_STRICT_ATTRIBUTION=false`.

### Neutral

- Assist and FlowSession can remain **handles** after rebind.  
- `flow.session.*` event names may stay; payloads must gain real session attribution when ready.

## Alternatives considered

| Option | Why rejected |
|--------|----------------|
| Keep session ≡ instance | Blocks multi-instance and ownership; confuses Grove walk |
| Session only as product SessionService | Repeats dual-path; no system seat (fails ADR-026) |
| Watch-only theme first | Leaves bind law and multi-attach weak |
| Full user plane now | Scope explosion; not required for glue |
| Shared plane-store framework first | Blocks delivery; store per plane is enough now |
| Soft dual-own for admin UX | Breaks cancel/watch truth; use impersonation/grants later (D11) |
| Active as cross-session pass | Confuses focus with ownership; reintroduces entropy |

## Follow-up

- [x] Execute [VISION-0.58](../vision/closed/VISION-0.58.md) slices through **0.58.13**.  
- [x] Execute close plan **0.58.14–0.58.20** ([VISION-0.58 §6.2](../vision/closed/VISION-0.58.md)).  
- [x] Close **SD-008** at theme exit; residual SI honest.  
- [x] Accept this ADR at theme exit **0.58.20**.  
- [ ] Later: user plane + session impersonation / delegate grants (D11).  
- [ ] Later: surface deflation / walk handles — [VISION-SURFACE-DEFLATION](../vision/VISION-SURFACE-DEFLATION.md) (SI-002 family, SU-*).

### D12 — Service sessions for automated start (0.58.13)

Outside interaction **binds** a session (D3). Automated **start** (work drain, schedules,
host housekeeping) is not an outside subject and **must not** invent a dual “no session”
law when the plane is ready.

Use **service sessions**: stable `sess-svc-{origin}` records with metadata
`kind=service` and `origin=…`. Prefer origin grouping (e.g. `work-drain:{flow}`) over one
mega root for all automation. Well-known host seat: `sess-svc-host`.

Workloads **inherit** the owning job’s session (EventContext / metadata). Do not create a
separate “workload session” type for effects under a job.

### D13 — Session owns surface context (0.58.14 ✅ seat)

Surfaces do not invent dual identity slots as truth. Product **SessionService** shapes a
**BoundSurface** (system `session_id`, continue `instance_id`, kind, origin, session metadata).
Transport (cookie, header, WS, CLI) carries bind proof only. Surface dogfood of the
handle is **0.58.17** (kit `resolve_session_service` + dogfood ✅).

### D14 — Session metadata vs job metadata (0.58.14 ✅ API)

Walk / surface / attribution facts live on **session** record metadata
(`get_metadata` / `merge_metadata` on plane + SessionService).  
Run facts live on **job / instance** metadata.  
Do not use job metadata as a second session store or ownership graph.

### D15 — Session operate under owner gate (0.58.18 ✅)

Product operate verbs (`focus`, `list_owned_waiting`, `cancel_owned`) live on
**SessionService**. Cancel drives **system** `cancel_job` only after the owner
gate. Surfaces must not invent private session resume or unowned cancel.
`surface_view` v2 is the assemble-once operate envelope (waiting, refs, actions).
