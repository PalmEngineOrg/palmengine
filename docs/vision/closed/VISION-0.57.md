## 1. Goal

Give Palm a **true system layer** that matches the whole organism.

The full picture of Palm lives in [PALM.md](../../PALM.md):

- what Palm is for,
- the **job path** (definition → pattern → job → effects → events),
- core machines, plugins, product, surfaces,
- ports and planes as **consequences** of that path,
- honest gaps.

This theme makes the **code** match that map for:

- the running machine (engines + planes),
- the **ports** that graphs and product must share,
- the line between **system** and **shared** code.

**Success:** [PALM.md](../../PALM.md) stays true. The tree follows it.  
New work has a home. Workarounds stop being the default path.

This theme is **not** “add REST for workloads.”  
This theme is **structure**.  
This theme is **not** only the dual-path pain — it is the kernel of the whole named Palm.

---

## 2. Why now

1. Workload work showed a **split brain**: graphs bind engines; edges bind services.  
2. `palm.common` holds **system** and **shared** at once. It grows without purpose.  
3. Session has no clean home.  
4. `PalmKernel` names infra. It does not name the effect surface of a running Palm.  
5. Palm is **not** in production. We may break and rewrite. We must not paper over debt.

0.56 gave **direction**. That is enough for a scout.  
0.57 takes the **rare chance** to name and clean the wiring.

---

## 3. Non-goals

| Out of scope for 0.57 | Why |
|-----------------------|-----|
| Full Grove multi-Palm mesh | Later; needs local system first |
| Full session product UI | Session **home** yes; full plane theme later |
| Feature race for every workload runtime | Structure first; runners follow ports |
| Keep all old paths for compatibility | Pre-1.0; truth over comfort |
| Rewrite every legacy doc to STE in one pass | New + touched docs only |

---

## 4. Principles (bind to PALM.md)

See [PALM.md §5](../../PALM.md) for the full law list. Short form:

1. One purpose per module.  
2. Core stays pure.  
3. Register downward.  
4. Effects use **named ports**.  
5. Planes are **system**.  
6. Product is **userland**.  
7. Surfaces stay thin.  
8. Shared is not a dump.  
9. Same ports for graphs and product.  
10. Break for truth; record residual debt.

**Documentation:** All new theme text uses **Simplified Technical English**.

---

## 5. Target shape (high level)

```text
Surfaces  →  Product (services)  →  ports  →  System  →  Core
                ↑                              │
             Plugins register ─────────────────┘
Shared = libraries only (not system)
App host = boot and composition (not a second kernel API)
```

| Piece | Target |
|-------|--------|
| **System instance** | One object (or clear façade) that holds engines and exposes ports |
| **Execution port** | First port: resource + workload effects (and related job bind as needed) |
| **Planes** | Event, work, wait stay system-owned; session gets a seat |
| **Shared** | What remains after system leaves `common` |
| **Product** | Calls ports on a resolved system instance |
| **Patterns** | Build against ports, not engine bags |

Package path is **`palm.system`** (landed). Residual modules and shims are debt, not an open naming debate.  
The purpose is fixed here. The path is not holy.

---

## 6. Ordered work (high level)

Slices stay **one purpose each**. Numbers lock at execution time.

| Order | Slice spirit | Result |
|------:|--------------|--------|
| **0** | Plan + map + ADR | [PALM.md](../../PALM.md), this file, ADR-026 — ✅ |
| **1** | Debt archive + low-level | Live SD register; era archive; [SYSTEM-LOW-LEVEL](../../SYSTEM-LOW-LEVEL.md) — ✅ **0.57.1** |
| **2** | Name the system boundary in code | `palm.system` package; system vs shared visible — ✅ **0.57.2** |
| **3** | Execution port v1 | Named interface on BaseRuntime — ✅ type+impl |
| **4** | Rebind graphs | P2 invoker/driver + port bridges — ✅ **0.57.4** |
| **5** | Rebind product | Effect methods on port — ✅ (list/doctor residual) |
| **6** | Deflate shared | BaseRuntime + planes under `palm.system`; SD-012 shims — ✅ **0.57.6** |
| **7** | Edge policy | No new engine shortcuts; list residual bypass as debt — ✅ **0.57.7** |
| **8+** | Debt cleanup | Import sweep, catalog truth, docs, wave F, shim delete — ✅ **0.57.8–12** |
| **exit** | Theme exit | ✅ **0.57.14** — residual SU-*/SD-008 honest; ADR-026 Accepted; map true |

**Rule:** Do not ship more dual-path policy (e.g. “workload only through CQRS”) as the main fix.

## 7. Relation to 0.56 and Grove

| Theme | Role |
|-------|------|
| **0.55** | Law of start / continue — keep |
| **0.56** | Workload **scout** — engine + leaf direction; may rewrite bindings |
| **0.57** | **System name and wiring** — main goal |
| **Session plane** | **0.58 open** ([VISION-0.58](VISION-0.58.md)) |
| **Grove** | Still the multi-Palm north star; local system is the floor |

---

## 8. Debt

| Register | Role |
|----------|------|
| [TECH-DEBT.md](../../../TECH-DEBT.md) | **Live** — SD-* system debt + CF-* carry-forward |
| [docs/audit/TECH-DEBT-ERA-0.45.md](../../audit/TECH-DEBT-ERA-0.45.md) | **Archive** — PD era history |

Add SD rows for shims and new bypasses. Do not reopen closed PD IDs without new evidence.

---

## 9. Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Theme too large | Hard slice order; one purpose per patch |
| Rename theater without ports | Port rebind is load-bearing; names alone fail review |
| `common` move thrash | Move by **purpose**, not by fashion |
| Context loss mid-theme | PALM.md is the short memory; keep it true |

---

## 10. Exit criteria

Theme **0.57** closed when (all met at **0.57.14**):

1. [x] [PALM.md](../../PALM.md) matches the code at layer purpose level.  
2. [x] A **named execution port** exists. Graphs and product use it for resource and workload effects.  
3. [x] System vs shared is **visible** (`palm.system` / `palm.common` / `palm.kits`).  
4. [x] New debt register exists; old era is archived.  
5. [x] No new dual-path “special case” for the next capability (shims deleted; kits named).  
6. [x] Path we touch stays testable (`just check` / theme gates on structure).

---

## 11. Theme exit notes (0.57.14)

**Structure closed.** Residual is honest, not hidden:

| Residual | Disposition |
|----------|-------------|
| **SU-*** (explorer, MCP dual stack, CLI aliases, surface weight) | Optional surface work — not system law |
| **SD-008** session plane home | **Opened as 0.58** ([VISION-0.58](VISION-0.58.md)) |
| STE rewrite of old dense docs | Opportunistic when files are touched |

**Next growth** sits **on** the map: session plane, more kits, Grove — not dual paths through `common`.

---
