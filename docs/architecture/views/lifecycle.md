# View — lifecycle (intended)

**Status:** Stub.

| Phase | Care | Owner (intended) |
|-------|------|------------------|
| Machine up | Process lives, seats, loops | Boot + system |
| Structure ready | Desired structure holds; membership materialized | Structure management |
| Business runs | Jobs, start, continue | Orchestration + planes + product |
| Places | Named bodies as required by structure | Place registry / workload under structure hands |

Admission is the published signal that structure ready allows business that needs ground. It is not a substitute for materialize.

**Structure stack:** pure **reconciler (engine)** in core; **manager** in system (resolve → materialize → tick hands → publish admission). Detail: [structure-management.md](../c3-components/structure-management.md).
