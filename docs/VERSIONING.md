# Palm — Versioning & Release Convention

**Status:** canonical (established 0.46.0 · **theme discipline** clarified **0.61.0**). Applies to all future work.

Palm had a *de-facto* cadence (0.45.1 → 0.45.8, one feature per patch) but no written rule. This document is
that rule. It is referenced by `AGENTS.md` (docs + themes) and the review checklist.

**Also see:** [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) (agent rules) · [WRITING.md](WRITING.md) (VISION text) · [PHILOSOPHY.md](../PHILOSOPHY.md) (spirit).

## Scheme: `0.MINOR.PATCH` (pre-1.0)

Palm is pre-1.0, so the SemVer `MAJOR` slot stays `0` and stability guarantees are relaxed:

- **MINOR (`0.X`) = a theme.** One coherent arc of work — a capability, or a consolidation/debt goal. A minor
  **may** introduce breaking changes; when it does it ships a `MIGRATION-0.X.md`.
- **PATCH (`0.X.N`) = one shippable slice** within the theme — a single feature or tracked work-item (e.g. a
  `TECH-DEBT.md` row). One focused change per patch **when possible**.

> **Release cadence — embedded release.** Each slice is its own *commit*, but the **version is not bumped per
> commit** (every bump restamps 6+ doc surfaces — needless churn). We cut an **embedded release** — the
> `just bump-version` + `CHANGELOG` + doc-sync — per **minor or per patch-group**, grouping several slice-commits
> under one released version. Small steps in git; releases in batches. This is the organic palm flow.

> At **1.0** we switch to strict SemVer (MAJOR = breaking, MINOR = additive, PATCH = fix).

## Theme discipline (ambition over empty process)

Themes exist so Palm **grows properly** — one coherent intent, honest debt, layer law.  
Process that **kills ambition** or forces dual-truth workarounds is **wrong process**. Fix the rule; do not shrink the organism.

### Who decides (sole human authority)

Palm is a **single-human** project for product and theme authority.

| Role | Person | What they decide |
|------|--------|------------------|
| **Technical lead / owner** | **José Gabriel Gruber** (**José**) | Theme open/close; floor vs growth; when exit is proper; ambition vs process; ADR accept at exit; residual debt that stays named |

**Agents and collaborators propose.** They plan slices, implement, and argue for proper homes.  
They do **not** close a theme, shrink ambition to “finish process,” or treat a VISION checklist as José’s decision.

When docs say **exit judgment**, **theme stays open**, or **ambition over process** — that is **José’s call** to make tangible in negotiation. Ask him. Do not invent a committee or a silent agent exit.

### Floor, growth, exit

| Concept | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **Floor** | Minimum bar to claim the theme’s *intent is real* (e.g. “eyes open”). A **floor**, not a coffin. |
| **Growth line** | Work that may continue under the **same** minor while the theme stays open. Slices may merge, split, or extend. |
| **Exit** | **José’s judgment** when the home is proper, residual is honest, and declared green bars hold. |

**Exit is not:** ticking every seed table row, killing the theme because a checklist looks complete, or shipping a lie so the minor can close on schedule.

**Exit is:** the intent holds in code and docs; ADR Accepted (or waived honestly); residual debt **named**; spine green on declared modes; **José says the theme may close**.

### Prefer / reject (planning and execute)

| Prefer | Reject |
|--------|--------|
| **Proper** homes, lexicon, and discovery | Workarounds that “ship thin” by lying or dual truth |
| **Break ugly** paths; pay debt if feasible; else **name** it | Keep dual paths because tests freeze old JSON |
| **Big work** when the home is wrong | Fear of large renames / deletes that unblock growth |
| **Theme stays open** while intent is unfinished | Kill-theme theater for empty notes |
| Safety that protects **layer law** (core purity, ports, no second start/continue) | Process rules that shrink Palm’s prospect |
| Slice table as a **guide** | Slice table as a sealed contract that forbids needed work |
| Compress *paperwork* | Compress *ambition* to fit a short exit story |

### Non-goals vs forever bans

| Kind | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Not this theme’s subject** | Another seed may own it later — not “forbidden forever.” |
| **Forbidden always** | Layer law: e.g. no second start/continue path; no silent Design mutation; no fake green for absent seats. |

Do not write VISION “non-goals” that permanently ban growth Palm will need.  
Do write clear **layer forbidden** lists that protect truth.

### Workarounds

If implementing the theme would require a **permanent** workaround:

1. **Break** the underlying shape, or  
2. **Open a debt row** with owner and residual honesty, or  
3. **Do not claim** that part of the theme.

Do **not** ship the workaround as the architecture of record.

### Stop when the home is wrong (José)

When a slice hits a **bug that reveals a missing home**, or when the next step is a **workaround to keep the slice green**:

1. **Stop.** Leave the tree as it is.  
2. **Report to José** — what the unit needed, what the overlook was, what the workaround would hide.  
3. Do **not** keep pushing to finish the slice. Replan the real issue first.

Agents do not invent `if`s to protect a patch number. José decides whether to break, name, or drop.

### Slices

- Prefer **one purpose** per slice-commit (`feat(0.X.N): …`).  
- Sub-slices (`0.X.Nb`) and **merge of tiny slices** are fine when review stays clear.  
- **Extend** the theme with `0.X.N+` growth slices without reopening a seed file if the home is the same.  
- Numbered tables in VISION are **ordered intent**, not a death clock.

### Compost scouts (delete slices)

When a slice **deletes costume** (empty phase, unread flag, side-effect register, living lie): **two reads**, then **one execute**.

| Scout | Question |
|-------|----------|
| **Costume** | What does no work? Proof. |
| **Affected dead code** | What exists only to feed that work? |

The second scout names the delete set **before** execute: callers, builders, exports, extra bags, renderers, helper modules, tests that freeze the old bag.

Empty body is not done. Adapters that only fed it die in the same slice.  
Do not relocate the costume into a cleaner wire.  
Do not swallow a leftover on a **different** path — name it; leave it.

### The `X.0` planning release

`0.X.0` **opens** a minor. It carries the *plan*, not features:

- Adds `docs/VISION-0.X.md` — goal, **floor + growth**, non-goals that are real, principles, homes, **guide** slice table, debt budget.  
- Adds/updates ADR(s) for structural decisions (status **Proposed** until exit).  
- Names debt the theme will pay or leave residual.  
- Execution starts at `0.X.1`.

**Rhythm per theme:** `0.X.0` plan → `0.X.1 … 0.X.N` execute → **exit when José judges proper** → open `0.(X+1).0` when the next arc starts.

### Present vs archive (José 2026-08-20)

[STATUS.md](../STATUS.md) is the **present**. Closed seasons do not stay as slice tables in STATUS.

Do not copy the same season into PALM, closed VISION, MIGRATION, glossary, and TECH-DEBT on every slice. **Link** the home. [WRITING.md](WRITING.md): do not copy PALM.

| When | Touch |
|------|--------|
| **Slice** | Code + tests. STATUS: slice row + resume line. Open VISION: checkmark. Stop. |
| **Theme open** | New VISION, ADR **Proposed**, MIGRATION stub if contracts will change, STATUS theme block. PALM: **one** open-theme pointer. |
| **Theme close** | Move VISION to [closed/](vision/closed/). Fold any STATUS-only notes into that closed VISION. Accept ADR. Finish MIGRATION. STATUS drops the closed block; keep a one-line prior-closed link. PALM one line. Package stamp. |

**Archive home** for a closed theme is the **closed VISION** (and its ADR / MIGRATION). Do not add a second STATUS graveyard.

Compact reads STATUS → open VISION. That is enough.

## Artifacts by level

**Per minor (`0.X`)**
- `docs/VISION-0.X.md` — **required** (the plan; floor + growth + exit judgment)
- `MIGRATION-0.X.md` — **required iff** the theme breaks API/contracts
- ADR(s) for significant structural decisions
- `STATUS.md` **present** only (open theme + resume). Closed slice tables live in the closed VISION.
- `CHANGELOG.md` section at embedded release / close

**Per slice-commit**
- Commit `feat(0.X.N): <summary>` (or `fix(0.X.N):` / `refactor(0.X.N):`) — **keep the patch id** as the logical slice label; a `b`/`c` suffix is fine for sub-slices (e.g. `0.47.5c`). One focused change when possible; cite the tracked item. **No `just bump-version`** — the codebase version advances only at the embedded release.
- **Green `just check`** / `just ci` (lint + test + guards) — enforced in CI for the declared green bar of that slice.
- Docs: STATUS row + VISION checkmark. Do not restamp PALM, glossary, closed visions, or TECH-DEBT unless that file’s **meaning** changed.

**Per embedded release (a minor or a patch-group)**
- `just bump-version 0.X.N` — once, covering the grouped slice-commits (version + doc-surface sync).
- `CHANGELOG.md` entry summarizing the group; `STATUS.md` updated.

## Version sources of truth & bump flow

Two files hold the version, kept in lockstep by `scripts/version_utils.py`:
- `pyproject.toml` `[project].version`
- `src/palm/__init__.py` `__version__`

Bump with (**at an embedded-release point — a minor or patch-group — not per commit**):

```
just bump-version 0.X.N        # → scripts/sync_version.py --set
```

This propagates the stamp to the **auto-synced** surfaces: `README.md`, `STATUS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`,
`DEVELOPMENT.md`, `SCOPE.md`, `docs/llms.txt`, `docs/mcp.txt`, `docs/DOCKER.md`, `docs/index.html`, plus
MCP/Grok **doc mirrors** ([0.52.1](vision/closed/VISION-0.52.md)). Verify with `uv run python scripts/sync_version.py --check`
and `just docs-check`.

## Publishing

Publishing to PyPI is at maintainer discretion — not every patch must publish, and `X.0` planning releases are
typically not published. Release gate: `just release-prep` (docs-check + full-check + build). See
`DEVELOPMENT.md` → "Release & publishing".

## Current program — themes and debt (0.46+)

Themes sequence by **intent and dependency**, not by rigid T-number order alone.  
`TECH-DEBT.md` is the live ledger; pay or name residual when a theme moves.  
Security / one-line quick-wins may land early regardless of theme.  
See also [VISION-0.61](vision/closed/VISION-0.61.md) for a theme that states floor vs growth explicitly.
