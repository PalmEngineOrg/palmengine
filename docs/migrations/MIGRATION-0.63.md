# Migration — 0.63 Organism assembly

**Theme:** [VISION-0.63](../vision/closed/VISION-0.63.md) (**closed**) · **ADR:** [032](../adr/032-organism-assembly.md) **Accepted**  
**Map:** [PALM.md](../PALM.md) · seed [VISION-ASSEMBLY](../vision/VISION-ASSEMBLY.md)

Palm is pre-1.0. This theme introduces **assembly DNA**, **admission**, and **fail-closed** citizens.  
Impact is discovered as the gate rises. This file **grows** when paths break — do not invent dual hops to avoid updating it.

## Prefer (when seats exist)

| Goal | Use |
|------|-----|
| Structure decree | Assembly definition (DNA) loaded via seed or authority |
| Readiness for business that needs ground | **Admission** snapshot from assembly status |
| Choose shape at edge | Entry / mode / DNA id seed — not dual profile soup as king |
| Packaging | `PALM_*` storage, paths, ports, logs, pool widths (unchanged spirit) |
| Household assemble | Assembly control / loop — **not** product |

## Behavior changes (0.63.2)

| Was | Now |
|-----|-----|
| No assembly seat | System phase `system.assembly.assemble` after `system.ready` |
| No admission surface | `BaseRuntime.admission` / `runtime.assembly` after start |
| — | Default DNA `local.embedded` → usually `may_run_business=True` after start |
| — | `assembly_skip=True` leaves admission fail-closed (empty) |

## Behavior changes (0.63.3) — gate raised

| Was | Now |
|-----|-----|
| Work-plane `able` = system started only | `able` = started **and** `admission.may_run_business` |
| Drain/tick could run with no organism readiness | Fail closed: `tick` returns 0 until admission allows |
| — | Enqueue still accepted (work waits); continuous drain idles when not able |

## Behavior changes (0.63.4)

| Was | Now |
|-----|-----|
| `submit_flow` / `submit_process` only needed `is_started` | Also require `admission.may_run_business` or **`AdmissionRefusedError`** |
| No coherence guard | `just guard-assembly` · `tests/assembly/` |

Runtime doubles used with `DefinitionExecutor` must publish an `admission` snapshot (no silent bypass).

## Behavior changes (0.63.5)

| Was | Now |
|-----|-----|
| Always `local.embedded` default DNA | Host seeds DNA from **boot mode** or **composition** |
| — | `ApplicationHost.for_mode("cli")` → `local.cli`; `safe`/`test` → `local.embedded`; server/prod → `local.server` |
| — | Explicit `assembly_dna_id` / `assembly_definition` still wins |

### Break inventory (pretenders)

| Path | Status |
|------|--------|
| Work-plane tick / drain | **Gated** (0.63.3) |
| `submit_flow` / `submit_process` (executor) | **Gated** (0.63.4) |
| DNA id from real dogfood shapes | **Seeded** (0.63.5) — refuse not yet hard-enforced on membership |
| Assist / MCP packaging soft-ready | Start doors gated (0.63.21); admission inject oath (0.63.22); browse residual |
| Host soft “definitions ready” dual flags | **Named** (0.63.23) — packaging eyes only; no second ready flag |
| Work-plane able default open | **Paid** (0.63.23) — omit able / `set_able(None)` fail closed |
| Composition dual structure after DNA load | Catalog paid (0.63.19) — seed map + env DNA + membership seeds; residual SD-020 soft-ready |

## Expected direction of break (honest early)

| Was (glue) | Toward (law) |
|------------|--------------|
| Soft “definitions ready” / host flags | Admission from assembly status |
| Profile + BootMode as structure king | Seed → DNA; status after load |
| Citizen starts with half-host | Fail closed until assemble (**0.63.3+** gate) |
| Tests that bypass readiness | Coherence suite: fix or delete |

Citizen fail-closed lands in **0.63.3+**. Until then admission is published but not all paths enforce it.

## Settings / env

| Kind | Stance |
|------|--------|
| Packaging (`PALM_STORAGE_*`, `PALM_DATA_DIR`, ports, log, workers, …) | **Keep** as packaging |
| Structure toggles that rewrite membership as peer law | Map into DNA seed or purge (SD-021) |
| DNA / mode seed (when introduced) | Chooses which definition loads |

## Behavior changes (0.63.13) — env structure seed (SD-021)

| Was | Now |
|-----|-----|
| No first-class env DNA chooser | **`PALM_ASSEMBLY_DNA_ID`** / `assembly_dna_id` seeds DNA (wins over mode/composition) |
| Caller `assembly_dna_id` skipped membership seed | Membership always seeded for refuse (dual shape fails closed) |
| Continuous drain only composition + boot mode | Also **DNA refuse** `background_drain` (structure king after load) |
| Structure env uncatalogued | `STRUCTURE_SEED_ENV` cartography in `palm.system.assembly.seed` |

`PALM_ENABLE_WORK_DRAIN_SERVICE` is gone. DNA lists `work_drain`; omit is enough.

## Behavior changes (0.63.14) — place spawn port

| Was | Now |
|-----|-----|
| ENSURE_PLACE only marked ledger ready | Optional **PlaceSpawnPort** runs first; ledger records outcome |
| No OS place contract | `os:` places **fail closed** without body handle (`os_spawn_not_configured`) |
| — | `RegisteredPlaceSpawn` routes exact id / prefix strategies |

Default remains in-process success (behavior-preserving for floor DNA with no `os:` places).

## Behavior changes (0.63.15) — household + OS process

| Was | Now |
|-----|-----|
| Default hands = place book only | **`HouseholdEffectPort`** — places + projection/policy/seed intents |
| `os:` only accept pre-supplied handle | **`OsProcessRegistry`** spawns `argv`/`command`; release terminates |
| Structure intents recorded no-op | Invalidate → `PROJECTION_FAILED`; refresh → `PROJECTION_LOADED`; policy re-checks refuse; seed finishes |

## Behavior changes (0.63.16) — workload place book

| Was | Now |
|-----|-----|
| No workload place strategy | **`workload:`** prefix via `WorkloadPlaceSpawn` / WorkloadEngine |
| Unbound place soft? | Fail closed: `workload_engine_not_bound` |
| — | `combined_structure_spawn_port` routes `os:` + `workload:` |

## Behavior changes (0.63.17) — host structure bind

| Was | Now |
|-----|-----|
| Default assemble seat = in-process place spawn only | **Combined** `os:` + `workload:` spawn on household hands |
| Workload engine only in tests | **`system.assembly.assemble`** binds shell `workload` when initialized |
| No opt-out | **`assembly_bind_workload=False`** keeps `workload:` fail-closed |
| — | Custom effect ports without place book are not clobbered |

Bare place ids still succeed in-process (fallback). DNA that requires `workload:` places can converge on the real host path after engines init.

## Behavior changes (0.63.18) — reassemble edges

| Was | Now |
|-----|-----|
| Same DNA READY short-circuit could leave stale refuse | Assemble clears refuse then re-checks membership |
| No named re-converge path | **`AssemblySeat.reassemble`** (omitted DNA → seat definition) |
| No force void of same-id READY | **`receive_definition(..., force=True)`** / **`engine.invalidate()`** |
| Place gone → invalidated | **`reassemble`** re-ensures places until ready or blocked |

Citizens stay fail-closed while phase is `invalidated` / `blocked`.

## Behavior changes (0.63.19) — membership seed catalog (SD-021)

| Was | Now |
|-----|-----|
| Only work_drain + DNA id in structure seed cartography | Full **`MEMBERSHIP_CAPABILITY_SEEDS`** for all composition-feeding flags |
| Bootstrap capability list hand-maintained | **`membership_capabilities_from_settings`** single source |
| Unclear which `enable_*` are structure seeds | Catalog + settings comments: seed at resolve; gates after load use composition + DNA |

**Not a break:** flags still feed composition at resolve (honest seed). They do not peer-OR after DNA load.  
**Named residual:** `enable_event_outbox` still seeds outbox *store* install via runtime start options (packaging); host recovery continues to gate on `composition.has("outbox")`.

## Behavior changes (0.63.20) — workload start citizen

| Was | Now |
|-----|-----|
| `ExecutionPort.start_workload` only needed a started machine | Also **`admission.may_run_business`** or **`AdmissionRefusedError`** |
| Product workload start could run under dual soft-ready | Same gate as submit_flow / work plane |

**Household:** assembly place-book `WorkloadPlaceSpawn` / direct `WorkloadEngine` is **not** this door — structure hands stay ungated by business admission.

## Behavior changes (0.63.21) — assist start citizen

| Was | Now |
|-----|-----|
| Assist scenario start only failed deep in executor | Product door **`require_business_admission`** first → **`AdmissionRefusedError`** |
| Menu open→flow create unguarded at assist edge | Same admission gate before create |
| Menu offered Operator entry CTA always | When admission closed: **`start_allowed=false`**, CTA → eyes (`assist/top`), admission nested |

Browse (list flows, menu sections, doctor) stays read-only. Session continue/resume is not this door.

## Behavior changes (0.63.22) — assist admission oath

| Was | Now |
|-----|-----|
| Assist digs **`resolve_runtime()`** only to read admission | Packaging injects **`admission_source`** (snapshot factory); product uses **`admission_gate()`** |
| Gate helper only understood runtime shells | **`coerce_admission_snapshot`** — snapshot · factory · object with `.admission` |

**Not a break:** fail-closed law unchanged. Fealty shape: published admission + ports — not host/runtime bag for readiness (VISION-ASSEMBLY §3).

## Behavior changes (0.63.23) — work-plane able fail-closed + access helper

| Was | Now |
|-----|-----|
| Work plane **`able` default True** when omitted | **Default False** — attach omit, `set_able(None)`, install missing able all refuse |
| Admission inject open-coded in host provider | **`admission_source_from_runtime_resolver`** shared helper (no product base class) |

**Break only for custom attach** that assumed soft-open drain without wiring `able`. Host/runtime path already binds `started ∧ admission`. Unit drain tests must pass `able=lambda: True` when testing mechanics without assembly.

## Behavior changes (0.63.24) — resource invoke citizen

| Was | Now |
|-----|-----|
| `ExecutionPort.invoke_resource` only needed a started machine / engine | Also **`admission.may_run_business`** or **`AdmissionRefusedError`** |
| Product / MCP / host resource invoke could run under dual soft-ready | Same gate as submit_flow / start_workload / work plane |

**Not this door (must be named residual, not silent dual):** direct **`ResourceEngine.invoke`** (unit tests, engine packaging) — not the ExecutionPort citizen path. Graph effects and product services go through the port. Residual row: **SD-020** · inventory `execution.resource_engine_dig`.

## Behavior changes (0.63.25) — product continue + residual honesty

| Was | Now |
|-----|-----|
| `ExecutionPort.resume_job` / `provide_input` only needed started | Also **`admission.may_run_business`** or **`AdmissionRefusedError`** |
| “Not this door” engine digs only in migration prose | **Named** on [SD-020](../../TECH-DEBT.md#sd-020) + kingdom pretender inventory |

**Not this door (named):**

| Path | Stance |
|------|--------|
| Direct **`WorkloadEngine.start`** | Household for place book; pretender if product digs for business start |
| Direct **`ResourceEngine.invoke`** | Unit/non-port free; pretender if product digs for business effects |
| Wait plane → **`orchestration.resume_job`** | **Paid 0.63.26** — able gates resume before orch dig |

## Behavior changes (0.63.26) — wait-plane continue able

| Was | Now |
|-----|-----|
| Wait plane match→resume always re-drove jobs | **`able`** must be true; else owner **fails** with **`AdmissionRefusedError`** |
| Install had no able on wait | Same **`started ∧ admission`** able as work plane |
| Residual wait-plane orch dig open | **Paid** — continue spine under one admission law |

**Break only for custom wait attach** that assumed soft-open resume without wiring `able`. Unit wait tests must pass `able=lambda: True` when testing mechanics without assembly. Target-fail path is unchanged.

## Behavior changes (0.63.27) — workload exec citizen

| Was | Now |
|-----|-----|
| `ExecutionPort.exec_workload` only needed a started engine | Also **`admission.may_run_business`** or **`AdmissionRefusedError`** |
| Product/graph exec could run under dual soft-ready | Same gate as start_workload / submit / invoke_resource |

**Not this door (named):**

| Path | Stance |
|------|--------|
| Direct **`WorkloadEngine.exec`** | Unit/non-port free; pretender if product digs |
| **`stop_workload` / stop_owned** | Ungated for shutdown/cleanup when admission closed |

## Behavior changes (0.63.28) — host outbox composition king

| Was | Now |
|-----|-----|
| Host spawn always passed `settings.enable_event_outbox` into runtime start | When not explicit: **`composition.has("outbox")`** kings store wire |
| Settings flag could peer-OR composition after resolve | Settings only seed composition at resolve (host path) |
| Dual residual `outbox.start_option_seed` open | **Paid host path**; bare runtime seed **named** |

**Explicit override:** `host.start(enable_event_outbox=True/False)` still wins (named dual if it disagrees with composition).  
**Bare runtime:** `BaseRuntime.start(enable_event_outbox=…)` unchanged packaging for tests/non-host.

## Behavior changes (0.63.29) — assist continue citizens

| Was | Now |
|-----|-----|
| Assist session **input / resume / backtrack** only failed deep at port (`provide_input` / `resume_job`) | Product edge **`require_business_admission(admission_gate())`** first → **`AdmissionRefusedError`** |
| `resume_process` gated but unlisted | **Cartography honesty** — inventory citizen (enforcement via executor `_require_runtime` since 0.63.4) |
| Assist session cancel when admission closed | Still works — **named residual** (control path, same spirit as `stop_workload`) |

Browse / inspect / handoff stay eyes. Cancel is not a market-day continue door.

## Behavior changes (0.63.30) — flow continue citizens + cancel residual

| Was | Now |
|-----|-----|
| FlowSession **input / resume / backtrack** only failed deep at port | Product edge **`require_business_admission(flows.admission_gate())`** first |
| Flow packaging dug runtime for readiness only via deep ports | Host injects **`admission_source`** on `FlowExecutionService` (oath boy-scout) |
| `cancel_job` / FlowSession.cancel when admission closed | Still works — **named residual** (control path) |

**Not a break** for happy path when admitted. Custom `FlowExecutionService` without inject falls back to `resolve_runtime()` (same as assist).

## Behavior changes (0.63.31) — execution product façade oath

| Was | Now |
|-----|-----|
| Workload/Provider/Process product doors only failed deep at ExecutionPort / executor | Product edge **`require_business_admission(admission_gate())`** first |
| Only flows (+ assist) had `admission_source` inject | Host injects **shared** source on flows · providers · processes · workloads |
| Workload product stop when admission closed | Still works — **named residual** |

| Product door | Gate |
|--------------|------|
| `workloads.start` / `.exec` | citizen |
| `providers.invoke` | citizen |
| `processes.prepare` / `.submit` / `.run` | citizen |
| `workloads.stop` / `.cancel` | control residual |

Deep ports remain a second wall. Custom services without inject fall back to `resolve_runtime()`.

## Behavior changes (0.63.32) — flow product start citizens + soft catalog residual

| Was | Now |
|-----|-----|
| Flow product **start** (`submit_flow_body` / `run_wizard` / `run_flow`) only failed deep at port/executor | Product edge **`require_business_admission(flows.admission_gate())`** first |
| LIST / DESCRIBE when admission closed | Still works — **named residual** (soft catalog browse, same spirit as assist menu eyes) |

Continue was already paid (**0.63.30**). Assist open→create remains its own citizen (**0.63.21**). Host inject for flows was already wired (**0.63.30**).

**Not a break** for happy path when admitted.

## Behavior changes (0.63.33) — host packaging market-day + kernel dig residual

| Was | Now |
|-----|-----|
| Host public **submit / provide / resume / invoke** only failed deep at port | Packaging edge **`require_business_admission(host.admission)`** first |
| CQRS **SubmitFlow/Process · ProvideInput · ResumeProcess · Prepare/SubmitPlans** only deep | **PalmCommandHandlers** gate admission before kernel/executor dig |
| CancelJob / cancel when admission closed | Still works — **named residual** (control path) |
| `PalmKernel` / bare `BaseRuntime` public doors | Still port-gated only — **named residual** if product digs past host packaging |

Product façades (assist · flows · execution services) remain the preferred peasant path. Host is packaging crown, not a substitute for product inject.

**Not a break** for happy path when admitted.

## Behavior changes (0.63.34) — surface fealty boy-scout

| Was | Now |
|-----|-----|
| CLI **resume_job** dug `host.app` (kernel) | **`host.resume_job`** packaging door (admission) |
| CLI resource **invoke** dug kernel | **`host.invoke_resource`** packaging door |
| SSR explorer **invoke / resume_wizard** dug `runtime.execution` | Host when attached; host-less **admit + port** |
| Wizard CQRS **Provide / Backtrack** only deep at port | Pattern handler **`require_business_admission(runtime)`** first |

**Not a break** for happy path when admitted. Surfaces that still dig kernel/runtime for business are pretenders under **kernel.direct_dig** residual.

## Behavior changes (0.63.35) — REST admission voice

| Was | Now |
|-----|-----|
| Closed-gate market-day REST often **500 `submit_failed`** | **503 `admission_refused`** with admission detail |
| Closed-gate continue often **400 `input_rejected`** (because `AdmissionRefusedError` ⊆ `RuntimeError`) | **503 `admission_refused`** first |
| Clients could not tell gate closed from internal failure | Distinct error code + non-500 status |

**Not a break** for happy path when admitted. Clients that only checked for 500 on submit may need to treat **503 + `admission_refused`** as retry-when-ready (organism closed), not as a server bug.

## Behavior changes (0.63.36) — MCP + WebSocket admission voice

| Was | Now |
|-----|-----|
| MCP in-process closed-gate often **500** or **400** `PalmRestError` | **503** + `error: admission_refused` |
| WebSocket assist closed-gate **`internal`** | Error code **`admission_refused`** |
| HTTP MCP via REST | Already honest after **0.63.35** |

**Not a break** for happy path when admitted. Agents/tools that only matched generic errors should treat **`admission_refused`** as organism closed, not tool bug.

## Behavior changes (0.63.37) — CLI + SSR explorer admission voice

| Was | Now |
|-----|-----|
| CLI market-day/continue printed bare red exception text | **`admission_refused`** Rich label + detail |
| SSR explorer banners used raw `str(exc)` | Prefix **`admission_refused:`** when gate closed |
| Wizard backtrack only caught TypeError/ValueError | Also **RuntimeError** so admission refusal is not unhandled 500 |

**Not a break** for happy path when admitted. Operators and SSR banners can distinguish closed gate from form/validation failure.

## Behavior changes (0.63.38) — exit residual ledger

| Was | Now |
|-----|-----|
| Pretender inventory mixed paid + open in one flat list | **`open_residuals` / `open_residual_ids`** + `paid_edge_*` on `kingdom_map` |
| Doctor silent on assembly admission / residual map | **Assembly** table: `may_run_business`, gated/paid/open counts, open ids |
| Packaging bag only gated/pretender counts | Nests **`open_residual_count`** / ids (cartography, not dual ready) |

**Not a break.** Operators and José can read the exit residual map without digging inventory source. Named residuals remain intentional (control paths, engine digs, soft catalog, bare kernel).

## Residual

Multi-process shared claim CAS remains [SD-019](../../TECH-DEBT.md#sd-019) — not this theme’s subject.  
Pretenders not yet swallowed: kill-date under [SD-020](../../TECH-DEBT.md#sd-020) / theme residual.  
**Discipline:** every “not this door” left open is **named** residual — digs do not become lifestyle.

## Product law (while theme open)

- Do not dig composition root for readiness.  
- Do not set “ready” outside the assemble path.  
- When admission is law on a path: **fail closed** is correct; soft-open is dual mode.
