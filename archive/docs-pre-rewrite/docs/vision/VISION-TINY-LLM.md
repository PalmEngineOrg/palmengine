# VISION — Tiny LLM (model as resource · context as flow)

**Status:** 📋 **Queue seed** — named **2026-09-15** (José: **tiny LLM**). Not an open minor.  
**Language:** Law uses computer-science terms. Spoken teaching words are marked once. They are not types.  
**Map:** [PALM.md](../PALM.md) · [WRITING.md](../WRITING.md) (talk vs law) · [VERSIONING.md](../VERSIONING.md)  
**Walk:** [VISION-NAVIGATOR](VISION-NAVIGATOR.md) (operator-guidance definition · presentation adapter)  
**Place:** [VISION-0.71](VISION-0.71.md) (place registry · adopt) · scout [VISION-0.56](VISION-0.56.md)  
**Compost:** [VISION-0.68](closed/VISION-0.68.md) (**closed** — costume; not this seed) · residual [SD-023](../../TECH-DEBT.md#sd-023)  
**Surface compost:** [VISION-SURFACE-DEFLATION](VISION-SURFACE-DEFLATION.md)  
**North star:** [VISION-GROVE](VISION-GROVE.md)

This seed does **not** open a theme. It records **needs** so later themes do not close the door.

## 1. Why this note exists

Palm is for **humans and agents**. Surfaces already drive the job path. A Palm may call another Palm. That aim stays.

This seed names an **interior** use of the same path. A running Palm may **speak** to a small language model the way it already speaks to other resources. The model is not the client. The model is not the system. The model does not orchestrate.

Teaching (once): **tiny LLM**. Law: **model inference as resource speak**. The prompt is not a personality. A **definition** builds the arguments. A **schema** accepts or refuses the result.

pyrmydir was a weekend test of a related claim (tiny judgement, two clocks, a 2B work loop). It is **not** a Palm product. It is a later **catalog definition** on this pattern.

---

## 2. Spoken words vs law

Talk with José is analogical. Docs must not treat those words as types.

| Spoken (teaching only) | Law term |
|------------------------|----------|
| Tiny LLM | Small language model used as a **resource** |
| Brain / cerebrum / cerebellum / life | **Capacity** on the job path (resource speak + nested definition). Not a new organ name. |
| Bot that uses Assist | **Application client**: an operator-guidance **definition pack** that may include a translator child. Not a `BotService`. |
| Palm is the dumb AI; models are smart | Palm **orchestrates**. The model **fills a typed hole**. |
| Context pyramid | Nested **flow** that builds resource arguments (bounded context). Not a retrieval product. |
| Driver | Fat **provider** that owns prompt and protocol — **refuse**. Provider **wires**. |

Use the left column only to teach. Use the right column in PALM, ADRs, and architecture law.

---

## 3. Intent

Palm coordinates work: definition → job → instance.  
[PALM.md](../PALM.md) already names **resource** (speak) and **workload** (isolated place). Do not invent a third spine.

```text
parent definition (guidance or business)
        │
        ▼
child definition  — assemble arguments (question, legal actions, state, files)
        │
        ▼
resource node     — speak (model complete / extract / decide)
        │
        ▼
schema            — legal value on the blackboard, or fail the effect
        │
        ▼
owner job         — continue (wait plane) or next leaf
```

**Allocate** the model process with the workload engine (spawn or adopt a **place**).  
**Speak** with a provider (one action, typed in / typed out).  
**Drive** the graph with orchestration (the flow builds the prompt).  
Do not collapse those layers. [VISION-0.56](VISION-0.56.md) already forbids that collapse.

**Human-first stays.** A person may still answer, backtrack, and resume. A tiny model on continue is a **translator**: messy text → a value the current question already understands. It is not the person.

**Agent-operable stays.** MCP, Assist-as-built, and Palm-to-Palm remain clients of the job path. This seed does not replace them with “models only.”

---

## 4. Split of homes (needs)

These are the needs this seed puts on Palm. Later themes must **leave room**. They must not grow a costume that blocks them.

| Need | Home | Must not |
|------|------|----------|
| Walk that selects work when the client has no definition id | [VISION-NAVIGATOR](VISION-NAVIGATOR.md): operator-guidance **definition** | A `BotService` or `GatewayService` product domain |
| Bind, present, submit, start, continue, focus | Presentation **adapter** (kit) | Adapter that translates language or owns catalog/doctor |
| Free text from a surface | Thin **surface** (Portal is a test shell until surface compost) | Portal as chat product or “portal AI” |
| Build the prompt / pyramid | Nested **definition** (child flow) | Prompt logic in the provider or in the surface |
| Inference | **Resource** action (provider wires HTTP or local runtime) | Fat model-driver plugin (isolation + I/O + prompt) |
| Weights / GPU process (~28MB class) | **Workload place** (spawn or adopt) | Model process inside the Palm kernel |
| Quality bar | **Schema** on the effect result | Slop on the blackboard |
| Scheduled or triggered “more autonomous” slices | Start path + **child jobs** that include a speak node | A second orchestrator or an agent REPL |
| First proof | Translator on **continue**: current question + legal actions + text → legal value | pyrmydir-shaped map as the first definition |
| Later proof | Assemble-then-speak definitions (pyrmydir-shaped, docs harvest, compact clock as another definition) | 2B as session orchestrator (Grok TUI REPL) |

RAM budget is a **place constraint** (tiny long-lived service). The binary and vendor are not locked in this seed.

## 5. Relation to other seeds

```text
0.68 cleansing (costume)          ← now; not this seed
        │
        ▼
Navigator (walk = definition)     ← intended invert; not this seed’s floor
0.71 place registry (adopt)       ← body of the model; not this seed’s theme
        │
        ▼
this seed (needs)                 ← first proof when both homes exist
        │
        ▼
Grove (many Palms)                ← Palm X still a client of Palm Y
```

**0.68** composts empty work and lying docs. It does not implement this seed. It must not paint a model into Portal.

**Navigator** is the walk. José named it as the intended minor after 0.68 (conversation 2026-09-15). That minor’s **floor** is the invert (guidance definition + adapter). A tiny-model translator is **not** that floor. It is a leaf a guidance pack **may** include once the invert is real.

**0.71** is the place (adopt). Spawn via `workload:` already exists (`0.63.16`). “Run a ~28MB model as a workload” is dishonest until the place registry can spawn or adopt a small service and consume it through a provider. Scout: [VISION-0.56](VISION-0.56.md).

**Surface deflation** composts Assist/Portal mass **beside** the new adapter. Do not grow the first translator inside the demo shell.

**Grove** stays many Palms. A tiny model is a **place** one Palm speaks to, not a new grove member.

---

## 6. First proof (when ground exists)

Not this season. Named so we do not start with the complex example.

A small language model (~56M class, intended ~28MB RAM) runs as a **workload place**.  
A thin provider **speaks**.  
A child **definition** builds arguments from the current wait turn (question, choices, actions, free text).  
The schema yields a legal continue value (choice slug or tool-shaped payload the owner already understands).  
An operator-guidance definition **owns** that child. A surface only submits text.

Coconut and other dogfoods are **definitions that pack may start**. They are not Portal features.

---

## 7. Open (not locked)

These remain questions. They are not architecture law.

- Exact model artifact and runtime (llama.cpp, SGLang, other). RAM budget is the constraint.  
- First place: **adopt** an already-running process vs **spawn** from a runner.  
- Whether the translator child is one shared definition or many (one per question family).  
- Compact clock (rewrite parent claims) as a second definition vs a later theme.  
- When API/SDK docs harvest uses this pattern (later than the continue translator).

---

## 8. Non-goals (until a theme opens)

- Open a minor or accept an ADR for this seed.  
- Implement inside **0.68**.  
- Make Navigator’s floor “the LLM theme.”  
- A `BotService`, `PortalService`, or `GatewayService`.  
- Prompt assembly inside a provider.  
- Let a small model orchestrate the session (pyrmydir REPL, Grok spawn as walker).  
- Embeddings, vector stores, or a fourth context layer as requirement.  
- Rewrite Assist / CLI / Portal in place.

| ID / seed | Role |
|-----------|------|
| [VISION-NAVIGATOR](VISION-NAVIGATOR.md) | Walk home — do not steal it |
| [VISION-0.71](VISION-0.71.md) | Place home — adopt (open) · scout [VISION-0.56](VISION-0.56.md) |
| [VISION-SURFACE-DEFLATION](VISION-SURFACE-DEFLATION.md) · **SU-007** | Portal/WS must not become the product |
| **SD-022** | Talk/metaphor as types — clean when touched |

*The model fills a typed hole. The definition builds the hole. The adapter only walks.*
