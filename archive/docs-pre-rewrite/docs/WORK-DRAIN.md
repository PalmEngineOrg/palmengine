# Work drain service

**WorkIntent** is Palm's deferred-work queue (0.37+): enqueue at signal time, **run when able**.

This is the **start** verb of [Reactive Interests](vision/closed/VISION-0.55.md) / [ADR-025](adr/025-reactive-interests.md):

| Verb | Unit | Outcome |
|------|------|---------|
| **Start** | WorkIntent (this document) | New job via drain → `submit_flow` |
| **Continue** | Wait interest on parked owner | `resume_job` / fail — see [EVENT-PLANE](EVENT-PLANE.md) |

Do **not** encode resume as a WorkIntent kind. Triggers, inbound, and schedules stay on the start plane.

Sources that enqueue work:

- `metadata.triggers` on flows (e.g. `resource.changed` → `todo-analytics`)
- `metadata.inbound` on resources (webhook / stream / poll → reaction flow)
- Durable **schedules** (`tick_schedules`)

Execution does **not** happen on the HTTP or event reader thread. Something must **drain** the queue.

## Two modes

| Mode | When | Use case |
|------|------|----------|
| **Explicit** | `host.tick_work(limit=N)` or `runtime.work_plane.tick` | Tests, scripts, `all_in_one` / embedded CLI |
| **Background** | Supervised `work_drain` → `work_plane.start_background()` | `palm host server`, production reactive paths |

Background drain is a **supervisor** service over the system **work plane** (not a host-private queue). It polls the durable store, claims due intents, and submits flows when the host is able.

## Enable background drain

The structure definition lists the name `work_drain` on `local.cli`, `local.server`, `local.all_in_one`, and `local.worker`. The walker registers the supervisor service. `system.background.start` runs that service when install start ports are bound. The host does not start the loop again.

`local.embedded` and `local.mcp` omit the name. Those bodies do not install drain.

```bash
palm host server
```

That command loads the **server** definition. The definition lists `work_drain`. You do not need an env var for inbound webhooks or triggers.

To omit drain, load a definition that does not list it (for example `local.embedded`). There is no settings or deployment switch.

Related knobs:

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `PALM_WORK_DRAIN_POLL_INTERVAL` | `1.0` | Background poll seconds |
| `PALM_WORK_DRAIN_BATCH_SIZE` | `10` | Intents per tick |
| `PALM_WORK_DRAIN_MAX_DEPTH` | `8` | Drop intents beyond depth (storm guard) |
| `PALM_WORK_DRAIN_WORKERS` | `1` | Continuous claimers (0.62; exclusive claim required) |
| `PALM_WORK_DRAIN_LEASE_SECONDS` | `60` | Claim visibility timeout before reclaim |
| `PALM_QUEUED_WORKERS` | `1` | QueuedScheduler job-drive pool (0.62.7; exclusive drive per job) |

**0.62 exclusive claim:** each due intent is leased to one claimer (`claimed_by` / `lease_until`).  
Expired leases return to pending. Default remains one background claimer.  

**0.62.7 job drive:** daemon/server surfaces use `QueuedScheduler`. Raise `PALM_QUEUED_WORKERS` for concurrent drive of **different** jobs (one owner per job). Independent of `PALM_WORK_DRAIN_WORKERS`.  

Multi-process shared store is **not** supported yet (one continuous drain owner per store) — residual [SD-019](../TECH-DEBT.md#sd-019).  
Capacity theme **closed:** [VISION-0.62](vision/closed/VISION-0.62.md) · [ADR-031](adr/031-multi-claimer-work-drain.md) Accepted · stamp `0.62.8`.  

Honesty: claim + drive pools improve **overlap** under I/O/wait — not all host cores for Python patterns.

## Explicit drain (embedded / tests)

```python
host.tick_work(limit=10)  # also runs due schedules when schedules=True (default)
```

`tick_work` / `tick_schedules` run when the work plane is able (`started ∧ ready ∧ work_drain`). Ready without the organ does not fire or advance `next_fire_at` (0.67.5).

Example packs (todos, inbound tests) use this path so behavior stays deterministic.

## Ops visibility

`host.control_plane_status()` and `GET /v1/api/system/doctor` → `control_plane`:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `work_pending` | Queued WorkIntents not yet processed |
| `start_plane_running` | Start-plane loop active |
| `work_dropped_depth` | Intents refused (depth limit) |
| `inbound_bindings` | Inbound listeners (0.43+) |

## Mental model

```text
signal (webhook, resource.changed, schedule)
  → WorkIntent enqueue (202 / durable store)
  → drain: tick_work() OR background service
  → submit_flow(target, payload)
```

Peer path on the **same** `runtime.event` bus (continue, not start):

```text
completer self-event (job.completed · flow.session.* · workload.*)
  → WaitMatcher (open palm.wait.interests on owner)
  → resume_job / fail owner
```

Inbound specifically: [inbound_demo README](../examples/definitions/inbound_demo/README.md) · [VISION-0.43](vision/closed/VISION-0.43.md).

## Flow submission (0.45.6)

Work drain calls `FlowExecutionService.submit_flow_body()` — not `run_wizard()`. Both accept REST-shaped bodies (`flow_name`, `metadata`, `state`); `run_wizard` wraps the same path but returns an interactive `FlowSession`.

## Inbound coalesce vs debounce (0.45.6)

| Knob | Scope | Behavior |
|------|--------|----------|
| `coalesce_key` | WorkIntent store | One pending intent per key; **latest payload wins** on re-enqueue (burst collapse) |
| `coalesce_field` | Per-event | Builds key `inbound:{resource}:{field_value}` from envelope payload — separate intents per distinct field value |
| `debounce_seconds` | Inbound signal | **Defer** (trailing): signals in-window update pending envelope; after quiet period `flush_debounced()` enqueues **once** with latest payload. Poll mode uses debounce as poll interval instead. |

Loop guards (internal inbound): `skip_self` (default `true`) skips orchestration events for the bound `work.flow_id`; `skip_flows` adds more; `skip_event_types` defaults to `job.completed` + `flow.session.*`.

Explicit / server drain should call `host.tick_work()` — it flushes deferred inbound before claiming WorkIntents.

## Not the same as

- **Outbox** — reliable external delivery of events
- **Inbound REST** — ingress that *enqueues* work; drain *executes* it
- **Wait matcher** — continue/unpark parked jobs; does not enqueue WorkIntents ([EVENT-PLANE](EVENT-PLANE.md), `palm.common.wait`)
