# Architecture Decision Records

Living index of Palm ADRs. Canonical folder: `docs/adr/`.  
Process: [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) §5 · template: [`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/adr.md`](../../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/adr.md) · library: [LIBRARY.md](../LIBRARY.md).

**Rule (0.52.5 / PD-020):** every significant architectural decision ships an ADR **or** an explicit waive recorded in the theme VISION / STATUS (why no ADR). Numbers are **append-only** — never renumber accepted ADRs to close a gap.

## Number gap

| Number | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **013** | **Unused — intentionally vacant.** See [013-number-reserved.md](013-number-reserved.md). Do not invent a retroactive decision to “fill” the hole. Next free integer after the latest accepted ADR. |

\*ADR-005 may be promoted to Accepted in a docs pass; shipped reality is the service domain API.

**Next free number:** 042.  
**Note:** **0.72** composition plugin membership **open** (ADR-040 **Proposed**, amended by ADR-041 **Proposed**). Place registry **0.71** **closed** (ADR-039 **Accepted**). System **0.57** through Authoring **0.70** **closed** (ADR-026…038 Accepted). Residual multi-process claim: [SD-019](../../TECH-DEBT.md#sd-019).

## How to add an ADR

1. Take the next free integer (`ls docs/adr/` — skip reserved vacancies).
2. Copy `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/adr.md` → `docs/adr/NNN-short-slug.md`.
3. Status **Proposed** until the theme lands; then **Accepted** (or **Superseded** / **Rejected**).
4. Link from the theme `VISION-0.X.md`, and update **this index**.
5. If a change is significant but an ADR is **not** warranted (pure docs, pure rename with existing ADR, trivial fix): write one line in the VISION or STATUS slice — `ADR: waived — <reason>`.

## Out of band

Historical design notes and plans live under `docs/superpowers/` — they are **not** ADRs. Promote durable decisions into this folder when the choice becomes load-bearing.
