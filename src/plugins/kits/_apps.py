"""
Django-style autoloading for kits.

Each entry in ``INSTALLED_KITS`` is a real, importable kit package under
``palm.kits.<name>``. Intentions (future kits without implementation) stay off
this list so doctor and inventory stay honest.

``INSTALLED_KITS`` names packages that exist. ``autoload`` does not import them.
Import the kit module to register it.
