RuntimeHost — structural contract for definition-driven job submission.

Prefer :class:`~palm.system.instance.SystemInstance` + ports for **effects**
(product edges, graphs). Submission still needs orchestration/event engines
to materialize patterns and drive jobs — that is this protocol's purpose.

Not an edge bypass: :class:`~palm.system.executions.executor.DefinitionExecutor`
is system-internal and types against this subset.
