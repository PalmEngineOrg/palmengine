"""Structure seed map — env/composition are seed only; after load, status under the definition is truth.

Profiles, boot modes, composition, and structure-shaped env are **seeds**, not
parallel law. After load, structure status under the definition is truth.

**env/composition are seed only:**
- ``PALM_STRUCTURE_DEFINITION_ID`` / ``settings.structure_definition_id`` is the explicit definition seed.
- Membership-shaped flags feed composition at resolve for organs that still
  live there. ``work_drain`` is not one of them.

**Full membership seed cartography:**
- Every ``enable_*`` / analytics flag that feeds composition is catalogued here.
- Bootstrap derives capabilities from this map — one truth for seed resolve.
- ``work_drain``, ``outbox``, ``journal``, ``projections``, ``compensation``,
  ``webhook``, and ``analytics`` install read definition ``capabilities``.
  Remaining capabilities still seed composition at resolve.
