"""
Host schedule handlers — start law for ApplicationHost.

**Ownership:** host boot owns *when* and *in what order* the composition root
comes up. Handlers here are the rules. Collaborators (kernel, spawner, CQRS
wire, recovery, workplane) are tools — they do not own boot order.

**Membership:** ``CompositionProfile`` still switches services, surfaces, and
capabilities other than ``work_drain``, ``outbox``, ``journal``, and
``projections``. Those organs follow definition ``capabilities``. Drain/outbox
loops start on the system schedule (``system.background.start``) after assemble.
Journal and projections are attach, not loops — the host slot reads the seated
organ. The host does not start them again.

**Break / harvest:** mid-theme breakage is expected. BootMode and PhaseSkip
are the switches. Do not restore import-order magic.

**Dependency direction:**

- ``ApplicationHost.start`` → walker + these handlers
- handlers → host collaborators (methods / coordinators) as a bag of tools
- collaborators must not re-enter host boot tables

Observation: SystemLog only (handlers do not wrap ``slog.phase`` themselves).
