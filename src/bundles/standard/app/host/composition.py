"""
CompositionProfile — *what* an app is made of (services, surfaces, capabilities).

The composition axis, twin of ``DeploymentProfile`` (the deployment axis, in
``roles.py``). A running app is assembled from one ``CompositionProfile`` and one
``DeploymentProfile``; the two are orthogonal and never merge.

Those names are not composition members — after structure definition load, install is definition
``capabilities``. Deployment may feed the settings resolver but does not OR at phase time.

Named shapes are saved records (``COMPOSITION_RECORDS``). The host
builds a ``CompositionProfile`` from that data. Preset classmethods are not the path.

Each record names the plugin packages it installs (kits, patterns,
providers, runners, storages). The install stroke walks those names.
``INSTALLED_*`` stays the catalog of real packages.

Each record also names transform rules. The same stroke walks
those names. Service names stay the phenotype field. The host imports that
tuple; ``INSTALLED_SERVICES`` stays the catalog.

Typed name-tuples + saved records — not a manifest DSL.
